I. Requirements:

The requirements for this Project are to implement the software-managed TLB, virtual memory, and RPC calls for creating Locks, Condition Variables, and Monitor Variables.  The TLB acts as a cache and gives the illusion of fast access to virtual address translation over a large address space.  Virtual memory is implemented to use main memory as a cache for the disk.  This allows us to concurrently run programs that are larger than main memory, reading 'pages' of code or data from either the executable or a swap file.  RPCs allow machines to run procedures on another machine via message passing.  For Project 3, this is done using a single Server with up to five clients.

II. Assumptions:



III. Design:
/*** OVERALL ***/
Exec, Fork, and Exit stay the same.  There are a handful of new functions to deal with a PageFault exception.  These new functions are described in depth below.  A PageFault exception can 'trickle up' and cause a handful of other behaviors.  The general flow of a PageFault exception is as follows:

PageFault_Handler (if page is not in TLB) -> IPTMissHandler (if page is not in memory) -> MemoryFull_Handler (if memory is full)

To model memory, we use an inverted page table (IPT).  The inverted page table stores the same data as the TLB, with the addition of the pages address space.  This allows us to modify the physical page's corresponding virtual page (load into/remove from memory).  We use memBitMap to allocate free space within main memory.  Additionally, we acquire/release memLock when searching or changing the IPT/main memory.  

AddrSpace saw some changes as well.  The PageTable now also stores whether the page is 'swapped' (saved to the SwapFile) and the pages offset in either the executable or swapFile.  We no longer preload the executable, because there is not enough space in main memory to do so.  We've added two new functions, SavetoMemory and RemoveFromMemory which allows us to load/save virtual page data.  These are explained in greater detail below.

/*** PageFault_Handler ***/
This is the function called when a PageFault exception occurs.  A PageFault exception occurs when a virtual address is not in the TLB.

We calculate the VPN, so that we know which virtual page to put in the TLB.  We then acquire the memLock because we will be looping through the IPT.  

As we loop through the IPT, we search for a physical page with the same VPN as the VPN we calculated earlier.  If we find such a page, we check to see that it is valid and that it exists in the same address space as our currentThread.  A page cannot be trusted if it is not valid.  Additionally, multiple physical pages can have the same VPN because they can be from different address spaces.

If we find the physical page we are looking for, we break out of the loop.  Now, we turn off interrupts as we are about to update the TLB.  We check if the PPN we found is not equal to -1.  int PPN is initialized to -1; if the VPN we were looking for is not in the IPT, PPN stays equal to -1.  If PPN is equal to -1, we call IPTMiss_Handler (explained below).

If the PPN is not equal to -1, we know that the correct page is in main memory.  We update the tlbCounter, which is an index to the TLB entry we will be evicting.  Before evicting from the TLB, we check if the page we are about to evict is valid. If the page is valid, we want to propagate the dirty bit to the IPT.

We then update the TLB, copying over the corresponding data from the IPT and setting the valid bit to true.  We release memLock and turn off interrupts.

/*** IPTMiss_Handler ***/
This function is only called from PageFault_Handler.  It is called if the desired VPN was not found in the IPT.  Thus, the IPT needs to read the corresponding page in from disk or swap file.

First, we find a spot in main memory to load the missing page into.  If there is no space available, we call MemoryFull_Handler... explained below.

If we are using FIFO memory replacement scheme, we push the new physical page number on to the back of the memory queue.  We then load the page into memory via the currentThread's address space... explained below.  Finally we return the new physical page number so that the PageFault_Handler knows what information to load into the TLB.

/*** MemoryFull_Handler ***/
This function is called when we are looking for a spot in main memory to place a page from disk/swap file, but main memory is full.  We need to find a page to evict, by calling GetPageToEvict()... explained below.

We then loop through the TLB, checking if the physical page we are about to evict exists in the TLB.  If it does, and it is valid, we propagate the dirty information to the IPT.  We use the address space of the page we are about to evict to save remove the page from main memory... explained below.

/*** GetPageToEvict ***/
This function decides which page to evict depending on what eviction scheme is being used.  If the FIFO memory eviction scheme is being used, we pop a physical page number from the front of the queue.  If the random memory eviction scheme is being used, we randomly choose a physical page to evict.  In either case we return the physical page number to be evicted.

/*** ADDRSPACE ***/
AddrSpace(OpenFile* executable): This function has bene greatly edited We edited this function slightly for multiprogramming.  Before allocating the pageTable, we acquire the memLock.  We then loop through the pageTable, setting each page's physicalPage to a location in physicalMemory allocated by our memBitMap.  If the memBitMap is incapabable of finding an empty location, we print an error and halt the machine (No more physical memory available). We then read a chunk of information from the executable's starting location, offset by our current (virtualPage * PageSize), into the spot in Physical Memory given to us by the memBitMap.

InitRegisters(): Edited this function to return an integer.  This integer is the stack address of the UserStack.  This function is only called when a process is Executed, so the process will only have 1 function with 1 stack.  We return the stack address so that the currentThread knows where it's stack is located.  When the currentThread ends, we will know what pages to deallocate from the pageTable.

NewPageTable(): This creates a new pageTable with size numPages + (UserStackSize / PageSize).  We then copy all of the information from the previous pageTable into the new pageTable.  We initialize the new pages, similarly to the AddrSpace constructor.  We find a place in physical memory for the new pages, using the memBitMap.  We then set the pageTable, numPages, and call RestoreState().  This is all protected by the memLock.  We return numPages, which is the new stack's page position.  This is used by currentThread, so that it will know what pages to deallocate from the pageTable.

ReclaimStack(int stackPage): This deallocates a UserStack from the pageTable.  It takes in a stackPage position and loops through (UserStackSize / PageSize) pages, clearing the memBitMap.  This opens up space in the physical memory for use elsewhere.  We also set each page to valid = FALSE.  This is protected by the memLock.

ReclaimPageTable(): This deallocates the entire pageTable.  We loop through all of the pages, clearing the memBitMap.  This opens up space in the physical memory for use elsewhere.  We also set all pages to valid = FALSE.  This is protected by the memLock.

/*** RPCs ***/
We gave user programs the ability to call Remote Procedures by editing our Syscalls from Project 2 (CreateLock_Syscall, AcquireLock_Syscall, ReleaseLock_Syscall, DestroyLock_Syscall, CreateCV_Syscall, Wait_Syscall, Signal_Syscall, Broadcast_Syscall, and DestroyCV_Syscall) and implementing four new Syscalls for Monitor Variables (CreateMV_Syscall, SetMV_Syscall, GetMV_Syscall, DestroyMV_Syscall).  We changed these Syscalls to do the following if Networking was enabled: (1) Validate inputs as only the Client machine can validate that the user program is passing valid virtual addresses that it owns, (2) Constructing a message, (3) Sending the Request, (4) Waiting on a Response, (5) Parsing the Response, and finally (6) Returning the pertinent value to the user program so it may resume execution. 

On the Server side, we implemented a method, Server( ), inside of nettest.cc.  The Server is an infinite loop that has the following responsibilities: (1) Wait for Requests, (2) Parse the Request to get the RequestType and its inputs, (3) Calling the requested Remote Procedure Call, (4) Constructing a Response, and depending on whether the Client Machine needs to wait on a Server resource either (5A) Add the Response to a Queue or (5B) Send the Response Immediately.  If a Response is added to a Queue (as is the case in AcquireLock and Wait), the Response is sent when either another Machine calls ReleasesLock (for AcquireLock) or another Machine calls Signal or Broadcast (for Wait). 

The implementation for our Server Locks and Conditions differ slightly from our original implementation in Project 1.  Because the Server has no notion of a Client’s Thread, a Wait Queue of Threads and a Lock Owner Thread no longer make sense.  Instead we store the Machine ID and Mailbox IDs of the owning Thread and construct a Response Message and store that in a Wait Queue.  This is equivalent to putting a Thread to sleep as the calling Machine will pause execution at postOffice->Receive.  Otherwise the logic is pretty much the same.

Since Machines will eventually be running the same user program and will need a new way to communicate and share data (as they no longer share a common Address Space), we also added Monitor Variables to Project 3.  This allows user programs to define arrays of integers that are shared.  They can be retrieved with GetMV, created with CreateMV, destroyed with DestroyMV, and updated with SetMV.  The logic for these methods is pretty intuitive.  All Monitor Variables are implemented as arrays as this gives us the most flexibility without needing to implement differently typed Monitor Variable implementations.

V. Testing:  (For each test case, you must show)
+ How to test

To test the lock and cv syscalls, go to userprog and type the following:
run lock and condition tests = 
	'nachos -x ../test/matmult’
	'nachos -x ../test/sort'
	'nachos -x ../test/execTest'
	For each of following, open a Server by doing:
	'nachos -server -m 0'
	'nachos -x ../test/mvtest -m 1'
	Open 3 Clients and Run:
	'nachos -x ../test/clientTest1 -m 1'
	'nachos -x ../test/clientTest2 -m 2'
	'nachos -x ../test/clientTest3 -m 3'

+ Test Output

- Our output will say pass/fail for validation tests. 

VI. Discussion:

All of the RPCs work 100% properly. We did not design our tests to run with -rs values. Our tests display proper functionality for the RPCs. 


/*** REQUIREMENTS -- PART 3 ***/

I. Requirements:

The requirement is to write a c user program that implements a passport office simulation. This user program can no longer access lock and condition variables on their own, they have to now request to the OS that they want them and then the OS has to provide them.

II. Passport Assumptions:

-there is a random chance of customers going to an application line vs a picture line first.
-filing an application and picture take a random time, between 20 and 100 yields.
-being punished takes 100-1000 yields
-customers sometimes go to the passport and cashier lines too early, in which case they are punished and go to the back of the passport line (They can now decide again which passport line is shortest).
-Manager will wake up an additional clerk when there are three people in any line, if not all are currently awake. People only get in a line that is active. If everyone is on break, the manager will wake up a clerk when a customer goes into their line
-money values of 100 600 1100 and 1600 are randomly distributed.
-the user can enter invalid input. must test for that.
-the customer ALWAYS bribes the clerk, if they have the money to do so. 
-you pick the shortest line based on the normal line. Then if you have the money to bribe, you get in the bribe line for that line.
-manager’s thread gets put to sleep when all of the customers have left the passport building and nobody else is working.
-only one senator at a time can be in the passport office. There are no senator bribe lines.
-simulation ends when all customers are processed and there are no more customers coming into the passport line.
-each type of clerk has their own money ‘pool,' the manager goes and reads each type of clerks money pool rather than the manager going to each individual clerk and getting the money.
-manager only prints out the money when there is a change in the amount of money that is collected.


III. Design Changes:

Our design was to implement it as close to possible as original. We converted all classes to structs, use enums for state, arrays for locks on lines and desks, structs for clerks. Every decision that has to be made by a customer or a clerk requires its own method. This includes GetBackInLine, MakePhotoDecision, ChooseLine, etc. We are using writeOutput to print to the screen just as we did for sys calls. once all of the booleans in the customer struct are true, ( bool turnedInApplication; bool acceptedPassport; bool gotPassport; bool applicationFiled;bool pictureFiled; bool passportCertified; bool passportRecorded; ) the customer is done with the interaction and can leave the passport office. Same for senators. In addition to a customer struct we create a clerk struct to hold its state, current line length, and the boolean customer information that it needs to know. And we hold a clerk group struct which holds data about the current customer, its line, the lock on its counter, and its money. This information is all pertinent to how its behavior works.  We have an initialize method for each type of clerk and for the customer. They set all of the values for the structs to be equal to the value of the CreateCV sys call. Decide clerk was similar to the first implementation but accessing different data structures in order to get information. The customer still decides the line to get on but passes the information via changing array values and booleans. He has functions to get back in line, make photo decision, pay for passport, punish too soon, etc. Output- The clerk, manager, and customer has its own section of switch statements since they are all having different interactions. In order to write output we created a giant switch statement with nested cases of the person interaction happening, the clerk type, cases of the type of clerk,and finally if it is a senator or a customer. We are making the create acquire wait signal and broadcast calls as system calls instead of making the calls to the operating system.
